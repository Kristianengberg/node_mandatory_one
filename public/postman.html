        <p>Postman is a tool for developing APIs. It allows you to send costum HTTP requests to your server. Often it's easy to test in your browser if a GET request works because something gets returned to you. However when initially starting out you might
            not have the funtions ready to test request such as POST, PUT/PATCH or DELETE. Postman allows you to send such requests</p>
        <p>Sending a JSON object in the POST body allows you to test if your method actually creates new data in your database</p>
        <p>The following image is a PUT request where we update the object anime_names with the ID of 1 to include a lifePhilosophy with the value of "100 situps, 100 pushups and 10 mile run"</p>
