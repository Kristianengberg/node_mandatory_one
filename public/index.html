        <h2>Welcome to a small wiki page about nodeJS, express and other fancy things!</h2>
        <p>The idea of this page is to help with getting started using nodeJS and express while also providing some tips and tricks and other useful tools to work with</p>
        <p>In the Get Started section you will start from scratch learning how to setup a project in nodeJS</p>
        <p>Should you already know how to do that, feel free to browse the other sections for whatever you might need</p>
        <p>In the Misc section I have included a few topics that are relevant to nodeJS and creating websites</p>
        <p>These include:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Nodemon</b>, a tool to help you develop node applications by continously restarting the server whenever you make changes to the project. It is tedious to always have to run the command to start and stop the server. Let nodemon do it for
            you!
        </p>
        <p><b>Postman</b>, a tool that helps you develop your API. This tool allows you to send various HTTP requests through its interface. Very handy indeed!</p>
        <p><b>JavaScript</b>, where to put it and how to access it! Lets make these static pages do more things!</p>
        <p><b>jQuery</b>, a JavaScript library used to make static webpages interactive! Hell yea!!</p>

        <h4>Make some coffee and put on the best chillstep playlist you can find and lets get started!</h4>
